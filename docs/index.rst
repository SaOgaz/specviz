.. note:: The layout of this directory is simply a suggestion.  To follow
          traditional practice, do *not* edit this page, but instead place
          all documentation for the affiliated package inside ``specviz/``.
          The traditional practice was intended to allow the affiliated
          package to eventually be merged into the main astropy package.
          You can follow this practice or choose your own layout.
