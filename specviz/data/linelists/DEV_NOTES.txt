Commentaries on Line Lists and SpecView Development

A.P.Marston & I.Busko, 16 October 2017

The following are some brief notes I took during our meeting.

- Current markers – okay, but extend tooltips to provide all information on line.
- Marker color there – should be default different for each group of lines selected (e.g. H2 or CO lines).
- Groups of lines should not all be at the same height within the plot (e.g. 25% below the top).
  Provide user with means to select line groups to be at different y positions within the plot – add as
  option on view.
- Allow line list groups to be viewed, also selected and edited to form new (smaller) line lists from
  a subset of lines in a list.
- Line list tables should be sortable as well as selectable by name as well as wavelength (or any column
  of information available)
- A nice to have: Automatic title metadata at the top of the plot, e.g. observation/object name, RA, Dec,
  instrument (grating/filter), length of exposure, exposure date/time.
- Redshift should be a user input (part of the plotting options) – it should be applied to the lines before
  plotting the lines. Don’t shift the spectrum. Redshift tool is not a good idea.
- We will need an optical line list that can be redshifted (down to near UV?). Action on me. Do you have
  a possible list (used with HST?), Ivo?
